# CodeAlpha Python Internship Projects

This repository contains two Python projects developed as part of the CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship. These projects demonstrate fundamental Python programming concepts and practical application of learned skills.

## Projects Included:

1.  **Hangman Game**
2.  **Stock Portfolio Tracker**

---

## 1. Hangman Game

### Description

The Hangman Game is a classic text-based word-guessing game. The player attempts to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. For each incorrect guess, a part of a hangman figure is drawn. The game ends when the player correctly guesses the word or runs out of attempts.

### Features

*   Random word selection from a predefined list.
*   Display of the current word state (guessed letters and blanks).
*   Tracking of incorrect guesses and visual representation of the hangman.
*   Win/loss conditions.

### How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2.  **Download**: Download the `hangman_game.py` file (or extract it from `hangman_game.tar.gz`).
3.  **Execute**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the following command:
    ```bash
    python3 hangman_game.py
    ```
4.  **Play**: Follow the on-screen prompts to guess letters or the entire word.

### Key Concepts Used

*   `random` module for word selection.
*   `while` loops for game flow control.
*   `if-else` statements for game logic and decision-making.
*   String and list manipulation for word handling and display.
*   Basic console input/output.

## 2. Stock Portfolio Tracker

### Description

The Stock Portfolio Tracker is a simple Python application that allows users to track their stock investments. It calculates the total value of a portfolio based on user-inputted stock names and quantities, using hardcoded stock prices. The application can also save a summary of the portfolio to a text or CSV file.

### Features

*   User input for stock names and quantities.
*   Calculation of total investment value.
*   Hardcoded stock prices for predefined stocks.
*   Option to save portfolio summary to a `.txt` or `.csv` file.

### How to Run

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2.  **Download**: Download the `stock_tracker.py` file (or extract it from `stock_portfolio_tracker.tar.gz`).
3.  **Execute**: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run the following command:
    ```bash
    python3 stock_tracker.py
    ```
4.  **Use**: Follow the on-screen prompts to add stocks and quantities. You will be prompted to save the summary at the end.

### Key Concepts Used

*   Dictionaries for storing stock prices and portfolio data.
*   Basic input/output operations.
*   Arithmetic operations for value calculation.
*   File handling (optional, for saving summaries to `.txt` or `.csv`).

## CodeAlpha Internship

These projects were completed as part of the CodeAlpha Python Programming Internship, focusing on practical application of Python skills and problem-solving. The internship aims to provide hands-on experience in Python development and scripting, covering fundamentals, data structures, file handling, OOP concepts, and exploring libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Flask.

### Mandatory Steps for Internship Completion

*   Share internship status on LinkedIn, tagging `@CodeAlpha`.
*   Complete assigned projects within the given timeframe.
*   Upload complete source code to GitHub in a repository named `CodeAlpha_ProjectName`.
*   Post a video explanation of the project on LinkedIn with the GitHub repo link.
*   Submit completed tasks using the official Submission Form (shared via WhatsApp group).
